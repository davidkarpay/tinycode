The strict safety level indicates that the system has been implemented with high levels of protection against potential threats. Here are some specific features related to safe typing:\n\n1. Four-tiers of safety levels: TiTyCode supports four different levels of safety for its users. This means that when a user logs in, they will be assigned to one of the four safety levels based on their risk level. Higher safety levels are reserved for registered users with higher privileges, while lower safety levels are intended for newcomers or less experienced users.\n\n2. Automatic backup system: TiTyCode has an automatic backup system that allows users to protect their data and settings from accidental deletion. The backup is performed automatically when the user logs in, ensuring that no sensitive information is lost in case of a malicious attack.\n\n3. Tamper detection: TiTyCode uses tamper detection to detect any attempts to alter or modify its data, code, or functionality. This helps to prevent unauthorized access and ensures that the system remains secure at all times.\n\n4. Hash-chain audit logging: TiTyCode also logs hash-chain audits as part of its tamper detection mechanism. This means that any attempt to manipulate data or code will be traced back to the original hash chain, allowing for quick and easy investigation into the source of the problem.\n\n5. Resource monitoring: To help ensure that resources (such as memory, CPU, and disk space) are used optimally, TiTyCode also logs resource usage information. This helps to identify areas where there is excessive usage and enable optimization measures to be taken.\n\nIn summary, strict safety levels in TiTyCode mean that the system has been implemented with high levels of security protection against potential threats.
