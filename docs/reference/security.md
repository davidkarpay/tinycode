# TinyCode Security Limitations and Features

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Disclaimer**

**TinyCode is a local development tool designed for code assistance, NOT a security or privacy protection system.**

This document provides an honest assessment of TinyCode's security capabilities and limitations.

## ‚ùå **What TinyCode CANNOT Protect**

### **No User Authentication System**
- ‚ùå No user accounts or identity verification
- ‚ùå No password protection
- ‚ùå No two-factor authentication (2FA)
- ‚ùå No account lockout mechanisms

### **No Data Encryption**
- ‚ùå No encryption of stored data or communications
- ‚ùå Audit logs stored in plaintext
- ‚ùå Legal authorities database accessible to anyone with file system access
- ‚ùå No protection against physical device access

### **No Privacy Protection from Law Enforcement**
- ‚ùå Cannot protect against legal search warrants
- ‚ùå Cannot prevent law enforcement access to local files
- ‚ùå No anonymization features
- ‚ùå No secure communication channels
- ‚ùå All operations logged locally in plaintext

### **No Network Security**
- ‚ùå No secure transport layer (uses local HTTP to Ollama)
- ‚ùå No VPN or proxy protection
- ‚ùå No traffic obfuscation

## ‚úÖ **What TinyCode DOES Provide**

### **Development Safety Features**
TinyCode includes several features designed to prevent accidental damage during development:

#### **File Operation Safety**
- ‚úÖ Automatic backups before file modifications
- ‚úÖ Path restrictions to prevent system file access
- ‚úÖ File size limits to prevent large file creation
- ‚úÖ Extension filtering for allowed file types

#### **Execution Controls**
- ‚úÖ Four safety levels: PERMISSIVE, STANDARD, STRICT, PARANOID
- ‚úÖ Timeout controls for operations (5 min plans, 30 sec actions)
- ‚úÖ Resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- ‚úÖ Dangerous pattern detection in plans

#### **Audit and Monitoring**
- ‚úÖ Hash-chain integrity logging for forensic analysis
- ‚úÖ Operation tracking with timestamps
- ‚úÖ Plan approval workflows for risky operations
- ‚úÖ Error categorization and recovery

#### **API Security (Server Mode Only)**
- ‚úÖ Optional API key authentication (`X-API-Key` header)
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting using token bucket algorithm
- ‚úÖ CORS configuration for web access
- ‚úÖ Request monitoring with Prometheus metrics

## üõ°Ô∏è **Recommended Security Practices**

If you need actual security and privacy protection, consider these external tools:

### **For Secure Development**
- **Git Encryption**: Use `git-crypt` or `git-secret` for sensitive files
- **Environment Variables**: Store secrets in `.env` files (gitignored)
- **Container Security**: Use Docker with appropriate security contexts
- **Code Analysis**: Run security scanners like `bandit` (Python) or `eslint-plugin-security` (JS)

### **For Privacy Protection**
- **VPN Services**: Use reputable VPN providers for network privacy
- **Encrypted Storage**: Use full-disk encryption (FileVault, BitLocker, LUKS)
- **Secure Communication**: Use Signal, ProtonMail, or similar for sensitive communications
- **Anonymous Browsing**: Use Tor Browser for anonymous web access

### **For Law Enforcement Protection**
- **Legal Consultation**: Consult with privacy attorneys about your rights
- **Secure Operating Systems**: Consider Tails, Qubes, or hardened Linux distributions
- **Hardware Security**: Use hardware security keys and tamper-evident systems
- **Data Destruction**: Use secure deletion tools and understand data recovery limitations

## üìä **Security Audit Summary**

| Security Feature | TinyCode Status | Recommendation |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| User Authentication | ‚ùå Not Implemented | Use system-level user accounts |
| Data Encryption | ‚ùå Not Implemented | Use full-disk encryption |
| Network Security | ‚ùå Local HTTP only | Use VPN for network privacy |
| Audit Logging | ‚úÖ Basic implementation | Logs stored locally in plaintext |
| Access Controls | ‚úÖ File operation limits | Limited to development safety |
| Rate Limiting | ‚úÖ API endpoints only | Not applicable for CLI mode |

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Legal Considerations**

### **What Law Enforcement Can Access**
If law enforcement has legal authority to search your device, they can access:
- ‚úÖ All TinyCode files and configurations
- ‚úÖ Audit logs showing all operations performed
- ‚úÖ Legal authorities database and search history
- ‚úÖ Florida court search cache
- ‚úÖ All generated code and modifications
- ‚úÖ Backup files created during operations

### **No Legal Protection Provided**
TinyCode does not provide:
- ‚ùå Attorney-client privilege protection
- ‚ùå Work product doctrine protection
- ‚ùå Trade secret protection
- ‚ùå Privacy rights beyond standard file permissions

## üîß **Configuring Available Security Features**

### **Safety Configuration**
```python
from tiny_code.safety_config import SafetyConfig, SafetyLevel

# Maximum security settings
config = SafetyConfig(
    safety_level=SafetyLevel.PARANOID,
    audit_enabled=True,
    backup_enabled=True,
    rollback_enabled=True
)
```

### **API Key Protection (Server Mode)**
```bash
export VALID_API_KEYS="your-secret-key-1,your-secret-key-2"
python api_server.py
```

### **File Access Restrictions**
```python
# Configure in safety_config.py
execution_limits = ExecutionLimits(
    forbidden_paths=[
        "/etc/*", "/usr/*", "/bin/*", "/sbin/*",
        "*/secrets/*", "*/.ssh/*", "*/private/*"
    ]
)
```

## üö® **When NOT to Use TinyCode**

Do NOT use TinyCode for:
- ‚ùå Processing classified or sensitive government information
- ‚ùå Handling protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA
- ‚ùå Managing financial data requiring PCI DSS compliance
- ‚ùå Storing trade secrets or confidential business information
- ‚ùå Any activity requiring protection from law enforcement access
- ‚ùå Anonymous or pseudonymous development work

## üìû **Getting Real Security Help**

If you need actual security and privacy protection:

1. **Consult Security Professionals**: Hire qualified cybersecurity experts
2. **Legal Advice**: Consult with attorneys specializing in privacy law
3. **Use Appropriate Tools**: TinyCode is for development assistance, not security
4. **Understand Limitations**: No tool can provide absolute security

## üéØ **Summary**

**TinyCode is designed to be helpful for development tasks while preventing accidental damage. It is NOT designed to protect your privacy, hide your activities from law enforcement, or provide any meaningful security against determined attackers.**

**Use TinyCode for what it's good at: AI-assisted coding with reasonable safety guardrails. For security and privacy needs, use appropriate dedicated security tools and professional advice.**
