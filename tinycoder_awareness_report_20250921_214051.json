The system utilizes an AI-powered model that can detect patterns, risks, and potential issues, allowing users to design and execute plans with confidence.\n\nHere are the steps involved in using TiynCode's plan-based execution system:\n\n1. Plan: Users create a plan by providing a detailed description of the task or process they want to automate. This can include instructions for how to perform various tasks, such as opening and closing documents, clicking buttons, and entering data.\n\n2. Execute: To execute the plan, TiynCode analyzes the user's plan and identifies any risks or potential issues. If there are any, TiynCode alerts the user and provides recommendations for how to address them.\n\n3. Modify: If necessary, TiynCode allows users to modify the plan to suit their specific needs. They can adjust timings, add new tasks, or remove unused ones.\n\n4. Store: Once the execution is complete, TiynCode stores the modified plan in a secure database. Users can access this database from any device with an internet connection to run the plan again, modify it as needed, or run it on demand.\n\nThis advanced feature ensures that users receive high-quality results without encountering unexpected issues that could compromise their data or workflow. By utilizing TiynCode's plan-based execution system, users can achieve efficiency and productivity while minimizing risks and costs associated with manual process automation.",

When you run a program in Python using the `python` command, TiNyCode will generate output for you automatically. However, not all output is useful or meaningful for every program. For example, if you have a long-running program that prints a lot of lines of output, this can be annoying and slow down your system. The explain command helps you understand what the program is doing by printing out the code it's executing, its current state, and any intermediate results or variables.\n\n2. By running `explain` on a Python file, TiNyCode generates an output that looks something like this:\n\n```\nExecuting Python...\n  0%|                                           | 1/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\n  0%|                                           | 1/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\nCPU usage: 83.76% | STATEMENTS COUNT: 12 | TOTAL TIME: 0:00:01 (0:00:01)\n\nProgram running time: 0:00:01\n\nFinished execution with no issues.\n```\n\nThis output shows that the program is executing for about a second, has run through 12 statements (which corresponds to the output of `print()`), and finished without any errors or unexpected behavior.

Specify the directory path using the \"cd\" command followed by the desired directory path. For example, to change to \"/path/to/dir\", you could type this command:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd /path/to/dir\n   ```\n\n2. Run the \"list\" command with no parameters or arguments. This will list all files and directories in the current directory, including any subdirectories. For example, to list all files and directories within the current directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   ls -a\n   ```\n\n3. If you specify a file name as an argument to \"list\", Bash will use that name for the base of the path (i.e., \"/path/to/file\"). Then, it will look in that directory for all files and directories with that name (which should include any subdirectories). For example, to list all files and directories within a directory named \"mydir\", you could type this command:\n\n   ```bash\n   ls -a mydir\n   ```\n\n4. If you specify multiple file names as arguments, Bash will use each name as the base of the path for each file or directory being listed. For example, to list all files and directories within a directory named \"mydir\", and then recursively list all subdirectories, you could type this command:\n\n   ```bash\n   ls -a mydir*\n   ```\n\nIn general, the \"list\" command is useful for listing all files and directories in a specific directory or subdirectory.

Here are some additional safety features that you can expect from TiNyCode:\n\n1. Safey Levels - Four-tiers of safety with PERMISSIVE, STANDARD, STRICT, and PARANOID modes. These levels help ensure that your code runs safely without risking data loss or security breaches.\n\n2. Hash-chain integrity logging - Logs hash chains for each file operation to verify their integrity against the master reference database, ensuring that all changes made by your code are backed up and safe to revert to.\n\n3. Automatic backup and timeout management - Creates backups before file modifications and has an automatic backup system with a time limit of 5 minutes and then a 15-second action timeout, so your plans remain safe from accidental changes or interruptions.\n\n4. Dangerous pattern detection - Detects dangerous patterns in the code, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, to help prevent them from being executed by your code.\n\n5. Chat mode - Allows for simple Q&A sessions with your chosen bot in a safe and controlled environment, which can be useful for testing, debugging, or reviewing plans without having to execute them.\n\n6. Propose Mode - Allows you to plan executions based on the safety level you want to set (NONE, NONE, CRITICAL), with detailed execution plans and risk assessments before acting.\n\n7. Execute Mode - Executes approved plans with full capabilities and safety checks, ensuring that your code is safe from potential errors or bugs.\n\nI hope this information helps you understand TiNyCode's complete set of capabilities!",

      "response": "To provide more detailed information about TiNyCode's capabilities for safe coding operations, we will delve into its safety levels. In the \"Safey Levels\" mode, TiNyCode operates on four-tiers of safety, with PERMISSIVE, STANDARD, STRICT, and PARANOID being the highest levels. The first three tiers are for risky operations while the last one is a higher level of security to protect against malicious code execution.\n\nThe RAG system used by TiNyCode in the \"Execute Mode\" provides detailed execution plans with risk assessments before acting. This feature allows users to plan and execute their plans while taking safety checks into account, ensuring that the planned actions are safe. The \"Propose Mode\" allows for more open-ended conversations between developers and coders without executing any code. In this mode, users can create detailed plans with risk assessments before acting, which also ensures that the risk of malicious code execution is minimized.\n\nTiNyCode's architecture comprises a modular design with separate components for each feature. The \"Plan-Based Execution\" system operates on four levels based on the safety level of the user, making it possible to switch between levels as needed.\n\nLastly, TiNyCode's FAISS vector store ensures that data in files is securely stored with tamper detection. The \"File Operation\" mode allows users to read, write, edit, and delete files safely, while the \"Resource Monitoring\" mode ensures that resources (CPU, memory, and disk) are monitored and enforced as needed.\n\nIn conclusion, TiNyCode's capabilities cover a wide range of safe coding operations in its three modes of operation - \"Safe Mode\", \"Execute Mode\", and \"Propose Mode\". By providing detailed execution plans with safety checks before executing code, RAG system, modular design, and FAISS vector store, TiNyCode guarantees the security of code for all users who operate within this framework.",

RAG stands for Robust AutoGenerated Generator and it is a modular design that utilizes Ollama and TiNyLlama to generate code based on user requirements. The tool provides an intuitive API interface to create plans with detailed risk assessments, execute approved plans, and perform safety checks before acting. \n\nTiNYCode also has four-tiers of safety levels: PERMISSIVE, STANDARD, STRICT, and PARANOID. These safety levels govern the execution process, from code completion to error handling to debugging. In addition, TiNYCode's safe mode provides a read-only access for no file modification, while plan generation and review modes allow users to create detailed plans with risk assessment before acting. The RAG system also includes a plan registry, 31 commands categorized by safety level, and CPU, memory, and disk monitoring with enforcement.\n\nTiNYCode's safe mode ensures that only authorized users have access to the code and that plans are executed safely without risking data loss or other damage. The RAG system also provides features such as hash-chain integrity logging with tamper detection for audit trails, automatic backup and timeout controls for safety checks, and a chat mode for safe exploitation and Q&A sessions.\n\nOverall, TiNYCode's capabilities cover all aspects of software development, from code completion to risk assessment to security checks.
